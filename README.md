## Chaining route handlers in Express.js allows you to define multiple route handlers for a single route, where each handler is executed sequentially. This pattern is useful for modularizing your code, enhancing reusability, and separating concerns. app.METHOD()

### Route handlers are functions in Express.js that are responsible for handling incoming requests to specific routes in your web application. They define how your application responds to different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and request paths.

## In Express, you define route handlers using methods on an Express application object (app), such as app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete().

## Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects, as well as the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.

# middleware can be categorized into several types

## Application-level middleware:

### Application-level middleware is bound to an instance of the Express application using app.use() or similar methods.

# Router-level middleware:

### Router-level middleware is bound to an instance of the Express Router using router.use() or similar methods.

## Route-specific middleware:

### Route-specific middleware is defined inline with route definitions using app.get(), app.post(), etc.

## Error-handling middleware:

### Error-handling middleware is used to handle errors that occur during the processing of requests.

## Third-party middleware:

### Third-party middleware are middleware functions or packages provided by external libraries.
